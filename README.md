# Computer Vision Internship @ IHUB-Data, IIIT Hyderabad

This repository serves as the official log and portfolio for all work, research, and projects completed during my internship at the **IHub-Data** at **IIIT Hyderabad**.

The focus of this internship is in the **Computer Vision** domain. This repository will be updated chronologically with new tasks and their respecitive findings.


## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a distinct task or project module.

Every task folder (for example, `/Task_01_Image_Classification/`) includes its own `README.md` detailing:
- Objective  
- Methodology  
- Code/Notebooks  
- Results and Findings  
- References and Conclusions  

This main `README.md` acts as a central index and table of contents.
